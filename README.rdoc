== Welcome

This is just a tool I used in order to strip some bbcodes from a phpbb mysql dump. The main idea is to take advantage of ActiveRecord database connector to speed up processing.

== How to use :

1. Update the file config/database.yml if needed  (point you development database to the phpbb mysql database)
2. In terminal, run 'rails console'
3. Execute 'User.sanitize_bb'
4. Execute 'Post.sanitize_bb'
